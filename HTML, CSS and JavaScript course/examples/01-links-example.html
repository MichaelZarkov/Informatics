        This is just a dummy section that we can link to.
        You can click <a href="#section-3">here</a> and it will take you to section 3.

        You can ignore the following text in this paragraph. It is here just to make
        the page big enough and not fit on the screen at once so that we can see
        the linking from one section to another better.<br>

        Let's try to make this section more exciting!!!
        Here we have a link to google.com: 
        <a href="https://google.com" title="Just Google." target="_blank">Google</a>
        (if you click it it will open in a new tab).
