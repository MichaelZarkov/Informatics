All materials from the Informatics bachelor's course.

Be mindfull when commiting large files (like pdf text books) because GitHub has a 100BMB file size limit.  
Note that GitHub has 2GB push limit. Git is smart enough to recognise renaming of folders so renaming large folders doesn't produce large commits, so it is safe to rename folders.
