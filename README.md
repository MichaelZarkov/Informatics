# Informatics

All materials from the Informatics bachelor's course.

Be mindfull when commiting large files (like pdf text books) because GitHub has a 100BMB file size limit.  
Also GitHub has a 2GB push limit so if you rename a folder larger than that, commit and push the operation will fail. You have to spilit it up into several smaller commits.
